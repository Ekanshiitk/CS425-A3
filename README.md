# CS425 Assignment 3: TCP Three-Way Handshake using Raw Sockets

## ðŸ“Œ Course Details
- **Course:** CS425 â€“ Computer Networks  
- **Instructor:** Adithya Vadapalli  
- **TAs In-Charge:** Mohan, Viren, Prakhar  
- **Assignment:** A3 â€“ TCP Handshake  
- **Deadline:** April 10, 2025, EOD

## ðŸ§  Objective

The goal of this assignment is to develop a deeper understanding of the **TCP three-way handshake** by implementing the **client-side** of the handshake using **raw sockets** in C++. This allows for manual crafting of TCP packets, providing insights into protocol-level packet structures and behavior.

The **server-side code is provided** in the official repository.
